## Description
scripts for analysing Forrestel wine data, 2015, napa

number in order of development/evolution and dependence

Makefile has examples of how to run each script

data should be stored in ../data. files as called are sometimes minor tweaks
from raw data.


## Manifest
* `01_functions_pheno_models.R` (Morales phenological functions (improved fork).
from https://github.com/MoralesCastilla/PhenoDiversity)
* `01_stat_functions.R` (simple stat functions; based on MOrales code)
* `015_data_prep.R` (from raw data to data clean enough for scripts.  prereq to most scripts with higher numbers)
* `019_predict_phenological_early.R` (fit phenological models iwthout optmization)
* `021_produce_action_units.R` (use phenological functions to produce actionunits from climate data for statistical modeling in later steps)
* `02_predict_phenological.R` (fit phenological models with optmization)
* `03_helpers.R` (like 015: prep more data for later more statistical
approaches)
* `03_predict_data_driven.R` (simple linear modeling, with out-of-sample
bootstrap (bootstrap/cv hybrid) validation)
* `032_predict_data_driven_specgd.R` (more adventurous model using "data as
model" to build lots of accumulators, regularized with ridge)
* `05_fruitionsci_data.R` (TODO: repeat 02 and 03 approaches on data with fuller
climate/environment data)
* `.Renviron` (maintains analysis state across scripts with environemtn
  variables)
* `Makefile` (has example commands.  e.g. `make main`, `make predict1`)
* `env.yml` (for reproducing the environment (incl most R packages))

## Usage
1. has example commands.  e.g. `make main`, `make predict1`
1. `conda env create -f r_env.yml`
1. `source activate r_env`
1. Install a bunch of R packages as needed
2. `make main` #for phenological models
3. `make predict1`
4. `make predict2`
